## Robot Camera

# Overview
This project is aimed at creating a simple rover robot which can use a camera to
identify navigational cues and interesting features when negotiating a maze.

The project consists of a) a set of CAD files used for fabricating the robot's
chasis, and b) source code for motion control, vision, remote operation, and
autonomous navigation.
